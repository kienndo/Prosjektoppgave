The dataset includes 10563 images.
Fishes are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 28 percent of the image
* Random shear of between -14° to +14° horizontally and -10° to +10° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -33 and +33 percent
